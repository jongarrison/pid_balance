# PID Balance Rail

This project is a basic PID algorithm demo project with both Arduino code and 3d printable parts.  

The inspiration came from an [Adafruit PID Controlled Sous Vide Cooker Project](https://learn.adafruit.com/sous-vide-powered-by-arduino-the-sous-viduino?view=all) 

That excellent Adafruit article linked off to two great Arduino PID related projects:
* [Improving the Beginner’s PID – Introduction - Brett Beauregard](http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/04/improving-the-beginners-pid-introduction/)
* [Arduino PID Autotune Library - Brett Beauregard](http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2012/01/arduino-pid-autotune-library/)

Brett Beauregard's articles are excellent and I started my project with the example code in the associated github projects:
* [Arduino-PID-Library](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library)
* [Arduino-PID-AutoTune-Library](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-AutoTune-Library)

## Development Installation

This project is written using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) which makes interacting with an Arduino board and managing libraries very easy.
